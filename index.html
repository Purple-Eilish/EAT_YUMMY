	<p style="text-align:center; font-family:cursive">Hospitality-focused, dedicated to excellence, and highly knowledgeable are just a<br> few terms most often used to describe Frank. This Brooklyn native was immersed in his family’s hospitality and the <br>foodservice industry from an early age. His father was an energetic and successful restaurateur in Brooklyn who kept Fredrick engaged in <br>the business throughout his youth. At home, his mother embodied hospitality and regularly hosted gatherings, <br>where Frank absorbed the importance of making people feel welcome. These two environments gave him his strength of character and strong desire to create warm,<br> inviting atmospheres where people could relax and enjoy themselves.</p>
	<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:cursive;">LOCATIONS</h1>
	<p style="text-align:center; font-family:cursive">Frank went on to build a career in hospitality, working in every restaurant position, from server and bartender <br>to ultimately the role of general manager of the fine dining establishment The Modern in New York City.<br> As a general manager, he took the business from a $3 million annual operation to $6 million. <br>The pandemic pushed Frank to explore his skills as a restaurant entrepreneur, which ultimately led to the birth of Water and Grain, <br>a great pizza experience celebrating the best ingredients, hospitality, and service to the greater New York City region.</p>
